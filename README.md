This is the current revision of the Tiny20 keyboard. It uses regular choc spacing and a promicro-compatible board. It's also compatible with both TRS and TRRS connectors and has a power switch and battery pads for easier wireless implementation.

I've also made a xiao-ble compatible board. It also has TRS and TRRS connector if you want to use a regular xiao board instead.
